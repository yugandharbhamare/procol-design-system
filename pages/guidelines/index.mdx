# Guidelines

Design guidelines provide best practices and standards for implementing our design system effectively across all products and platforms.

## Design Principles

### Consistency
Maintain visual and behavioral consistency across all touchpoints. Use standardized components, spacing, and patterns.

### Accessibility
Ensure all designs and implementations meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. Consider users with different abilities and assistive technologies.

### Scalability
Design with growth in mind. Create flexible systems that can adapt to new requirements and use cases.

### Usability
Prioritize user experience. Make interfaces intuitive, efficient, and delightful to use.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Usage
- Use components as intended - don't modify core functionality
- Follow component documentation and examples
- Test components in different contexts and states
- Maintain consistent spacing and alignment

### Color Usage
- Use semantic color tokens for different states
- Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios
- Test color combinations for accessibility
- Avoid using colors for information alone

### Typography
- Follow the established type scale
- Use appropriate font weights for hierarchy
- Maintain consistent line heights and spacing
- Ensure text is readable at all sizes

### Spacing
- Use the 8px grid system consistently
- Apply spacing tokens rather than arbitrary values
- Maintain visual rhythm and balance
- Consider responsive spacing needs

## Responsive Design

### Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320px - 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: 1024px+

### Mobile-First Approach
- Start with mobile designs
- Progressively enhance for larger screens
- Test on actual devices
- Consider touch targets and gestures

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Color and Contrast
- Maintain 4.5:1 contrast ratio for normal text
- Maintain 3:1 contrast ratio for large text
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information
- Test with color blindness simulators

### Keyboard Navigation
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Provide visible focus indicators
- Follow logical tab order
- Include skip links where appropriate

### Screen Readers
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include ARIA labels when needed

## Performance Guidelines

### Optimization
- Optimize images and assets
- Use appropriate file formats
- Implement lazy loading
- Minimize bundle sizes

### Loading States
- Provide clear loading indicators
- Use skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Handle error states gracefully
- Implement progressive enhancement

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
- Test across different browsers and devices
- Verify accessibility compliance
- Check responsive behavior
- Validate HTML and CSS

### Code Review
- Follow established coding standards
- Document complex implementations
- Include usage examples
- Ensure maintainability
